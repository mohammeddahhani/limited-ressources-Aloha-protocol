# Introduction:

This repository contains an algorithm to compute the expected number of successful transmissions in a limited-ressource 
Aloha channel with a finite number of contending stations.
The A-BFT beamforming training defined by the IEEE standard **[1]** is based on a medium access method inspired from and similar to that of the slotted Aloha protocol to resolve contensions in the uplink.

# Problem Definition:

<img src="/tex/f9c4988898e7f532b9f826a75014ed3c.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.99998994999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> stations are trying to transmit a packet over one of the <img src="/tex/29fb78801f1c792da0c00b3ed4246275.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.41213779999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> available time slots.
Since all stations are contending over the same number of ressource, a collision may occur between two or multiple transmitting stations in which case, they retransmit again.

At the begining, all stations start by uniformly choosing a random backoff in <img src="/tex/14a475464f068c9a3f7677679a2385db.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=73.2019926pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>.
When multiple stations choose the same backoff value they collide and their transmission fails. As a consesequence each colliding station performs another backoff by uniformly selecting a number in <img src="/tex/14a475464f068c9a3f7677679a2385db.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=73.2019926pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> and wait a corresponding number of time slots before trying again.

This process repeats until all collisions are resolved in which case we want to know how many stations succeeded their transmissions. That is, we want to find the probability distribution of the number of successfull transmissions once all collisions have been resolved.

# Model Description 

Let <img src="/tex/59f3a42931cc7c8e988fc88011c1f47d.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=142.09983974999997pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> be an initial state of the system where <img src="/tex/de3e4ddbaf93c2db6b330ad1998cc995.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.517775799999992pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> is the number of stations that chose slot <img src="/tex/77a3b857d53fb44e33b53e4c8b68351a.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=5.663225699999989pt height=21.68300969999999pt/>. We have <img src="/tex/91d5dd02fe1f8fc1e9ba9f866e71939c.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=94.46531159999999pt height=32.256008400000006pt/> . The set of all posible initial states is the of weak <img src="/tex/f9c4988898e7f532b9f826a75014ed3c.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.99998994999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>-compositions into <img src="/tex/29fb78801f1c792da0c00b3ed4246275.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.41213779999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> parts **[2]**. The probability of a possible initial state of the system is:

A station that collides and choose a backoff greater or equal than the number of remaining slots will quite the race and won't be able to succeed its transmission.
In this case, we can imagine that such a station choses an imaginary time slot <img src="/tex/f50853d41be7d55874e952eb0d80c53e.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.794543549999991pt height=22.831056599999986pt/> beyond tha last time slot in which all transmission are destined to fail.

Now let <img src="/tex/f7e9bfdb04bf00e6004d08e00908cca8.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=167.99862749999997pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> be any possible state of the systems such that  <img src="/tex/2a63b419921bbd989a2b167774458ddc.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=133.14940814999997pt height=32.256008400000006pt/>, where <img src="/tex/9f42f25156036208d2dc90066e5133f9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=17.771009849999988pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> is the number of stations that chose the imaginary slot.
As the above figure shows if <img src="/tex/ddc076dcde48b1b39299b8bf536b0b73.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=45.476512949999986pt height=21.18721440000001pt/>, the <img src="/tex/de3e4ddbaf93c2db6b330ad1998cc995.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.517775799999992pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> collding stations will uniformly be distributed over the <img src="/tex/f0317c7cc7bd73c37c9cd6cf189faea1.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=74.29886969999998pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> remaining slots.


# Algorithmic Solution:

Our algorithm iteratively runs the process described in the figure above for a given number of stations and time slots until all collisions are resolved. We use it to compute the expected number of successful transmissions given <img src="/tex/f9c4988898e7f532b9f826a75014ed3c.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=14.99998994999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/> and <img src="/tex/29fb78801f1c792da0c00b3ed4246275.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=19.41213779999999pt height=22.465723500000017pt/>.
